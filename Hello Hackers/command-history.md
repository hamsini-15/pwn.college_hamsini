# Command History
Here we are required to scroll to commands entired by me previously to find the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ABmNteU1PaPfnIXwVfZDbw_buMk.0lNzEzNxwCOyAzNzEzW}`

By pressing the up and down arrow keys I was able to access the commands written by me previously and was able to execute them when I hit `enter`.

```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{ABmNteU1PaPfnIXwVfZDbw_buMk.0lNzEzNxwCOyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I can simply access all the previuos commands entered in the shell and the shell stores the histroy of all commands written previously.
