# Intro to Commands
In this challenge I was required to execute my very first command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kAthUUvN25hVY8SpT_WsEWNBGR-.QX3YjM1wCOyAzNzEzW}`

Initially we execute the `whoami` command which does nothing but outputs the username (in this case `hacker`) in to the termial. We are then asked to execute the `hello` command to retrieve the flag.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kAthUUvN25hVY8SpT_WsEWNBGR-.QX3YjM1wCOyAzNzEzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ 
```

## What I learned
One of the major key points I learnt here was that Linux commands are case sensitive. For example executing `whoami` and `WHOAMI` will result in 2 different outputs
